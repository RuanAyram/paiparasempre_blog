If you are traveling by plane, choose the seats in advance, taking into account the convenience for the children, such as the proximity to the bathroom or the entertainment area.

Check if the room has amenities such as cribs, changing tables, baths, and other amenities that can make the stay more enjoyable. Also, choose a hotel or resort that offers activities for children, such as playgrounds, pool activities, and others.
