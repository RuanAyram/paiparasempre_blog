Homework is an integral part of the teaching and learning process, but it is often viewed as a burden by students. However, homework does not have to be a nightmare. There are ways to make this experience positive for students and help them make the most of their study time.

### Establish a study routine

The first step is to establish a study routine. This includes setting fixed study times and sticking to them daily. Additionally, it is important to create a peaceful study environment free of distractions.

### Break homework into smaller tasks

Another way to make homework more manageable is to break the task into smaller tasks. This helps students focus on one task at a time and avoids overwhelming them.

### Make homework an interactive experience

### Offer feedback and guidance

Offer regular feedback and guidance to help students understand where they need to improve and how to achieve their learning goals. This helps students feel motivated and confident in their abilities.

### Make homework a positive experience

Lastly, make homework a positive experience. This includes making the task fun and interesting, offering rewards and praise when students complete their homework, and being understanding when they encounter difficulties.

### How parents can help
